# Generate Fake Data in a Pandas DataFrame
I needed to generate fake data for a Pandas DataFrame for project. Specifically, I needed a fake name, email address and a number. I found two ways to create this and thought I would share here and help my future self so I don't forget. [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) is a great Python package for accomplishing this.
